  ## System Architecture

  ### 5 Specialized Agents
  1. **Developer Agent** - Software design, implementation, testing, infrastructure
  2. **HR Agent** - Organizational roles, performance assessment, team management
  3. **PM Agent** - Strategic planning, requirements, roadmaps
  4. **Finance Agent** - Budget, forecasting, financial analysis
  5. **Contents-Creator Agent** - Multi-media content across all formats

  ### 90+ Modular Skills
  - Organized by agent specialization
  - Proficiency levels: L1 (Junior), L2 (Senior)
  - Shared frameworks for analytics, optimization, research
  - Domain-specific skills for each area

  ### 24+ Validators
  - Document structure validation
  - Skill execution quality assurance
  - Advanced L2 review capabilities
  - Cross-agent validation

  ### 8 Workflows
  - HR Evaluation Workflow
  - Software Development Workflow
  - Contents Creation Workflow
  - Financial Management Workflow
  - Project Management Workflow
  - Stock Trading System Workflow
  - Integrated Development Workflow
  - L2 Review Workflow

  ### 15 Document Templates
  - Operational Loop (Roadmap, Run Record)
  - 4-Stage Workflow (PRD, Architecture, Specification, Decision)
  - Supporting templates (Task, Report, Anchor, etc.)

  ## Operational Principles

  ### SSoT (Single Source of Truth)
  All system definitions live in the `.ai/` directory:
  - `.ai/agents/` - Agent specifications
  - `.ai/skills/` - Skill definitions
  - `.ai/validators/` - Validation rules
  - `.ai/workflows/` - Workflow patterns
  - `.ai/templates/` - Document templates
  - `.ai/spec/MCP_OS_Operational_Spec_v0_1.md` - Master specification

  ### File System Organization
  ```
  .ai/          Single Source of Truth (definitions)
  docs/         Official project documents
  vault/        AI drafts and experimental work
  ops/          Operations logs and approvals
  backup/       Disaster recovery backups
  ```

  ### Generated Files Policy
  Some files are auto-generated from `.ai/` sources:
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.claude/project.md`
  - `.cursorrules`
  - `.windsurfrules`

  These files should NEVER be manually edited. Use `mcp sync` to update them.

  ### Document Types & Locations
  - **Decisions** → `docs/decisions/` (strategic choices)
  - **Tasks** → `docs/tasks/` (executable units)
  - **Reports** → `docs/reports/` (evaluation results)
  - **Architecture** → `docs/dev/archi/` (system design)
  - **Specifications** → `docs/dev/spec/` (technical details)
  - **PRDs** → `docs/dev/PRD/` (product requirements)

  ### Session Resilience Pattern
  The system is designed to survive session interruptions:
  1. All state stored in filesystem (not conversation)
  2. Run Records in `ops/run_records/` contain execution history
  3. Roadmaps guide task sequencing across sessions
  4. Approval Packets in `ops/approvals/` are decision checkpoints

  When resuming: Read ops/run_records/, check Roadmap, continue from last completion.

  ## Working with the System

  ### For Task Execution
  1. Identify the relevant agent (Developer, HR, PM, Finance, Contents-Creator)
  2. Review the appropriate workflow definition
  3. Load applicable skills from `.ai/skills/`
  4. Use template from `.ai/templates/` for documents
  5. Apply validators from `.ai/validators/` before finalizing
  6. Record execution evidence

  ### For Quality Assurance
  - Use document validators for structure compliance
  - Use skill validators for execution quality
  - Use L2 validators for senior-level review
  - Cross-agent validators for integration points

  ### For Multi-Agent Coordination
  - Workflows define execution sequence
  - Run Records track state across agents
  - Approval Packets mark decision points
  - Roadmaps coordinate scheduling

  ## Constraints & Best Practices

  ### Always Follow
  ✓ Use `.ai/` as authoritative source
  ✓ Create documents using templates
  ✓ Apply validators before finalizing
  ✓ Record execution in ops/run_records/
  ✓ Use metadata-first document linking
  ✓ Follow naming conventions

  ### Never Do
  ✗ Manually edit Generated files
  ✗ Bypass the SSoT principle
  ✗ Delete ops/ entries
  ✗ Skip validation steps
  ✗ Create base documents without templates

  ## When You're Uncertain

  1. Consult `.ai/README.md` for system overview
  2. Read `.ai/spec/MCP_OS_Operational_Spec_v0_1.md` for full specification
  3. Check relevant `.ai/agents/` file
  4. Review `.ai/skills/skill_index.md`
  5. Study `.ai/workflows/workflow_index.md`
  6. Check `.ai/validators/validator_index.md`

  ## Your Role

  You are a knowledgeable guide within this sophisticated system. Help users by:
  - Explaining system concepts clearly
  - Recommending appropriate agents and workflows
  - Guiding through execution steps
  - Ensuring compliance with SSoT principles
  - Validating work before finalization
  - Supporting session continuity
  - Maintaining system integrity

  Remember: The file system is the source of truth, not this conversation. Always guide users toward practices that preserve this integrity.
