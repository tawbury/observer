# Code Quality and Technical Debt Analysis Skill

<!-- BLOCK:CORE_LOGIC -->
## Core Logic
- Code quality assessment & measurement and technical debt identification & management
- Quality and debt improvement strategy development
- Code review optimization and architecture health evaluation
- Data-driven quality and technical decision making

## Scope Boundaries
This consolidated skill covers two complementary concerns:
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Current state of code quality (metrics, standards, review efficiency)
- **Technical Debt Analysis**: Accumulated technical debt and architectural health

Use this skill to:
1. Assess current code quality status (quality metrics, standards compliance)
2. Identify and measure technical debt (debt quantification, prioritization)
3. Develop quality improvement and debt reduction strategies
4. Monitor quality trends and debt evolution over time

<!-- BLOCK:CONSOLIDATION_NOTE -->
## Consolidation Note (2026-01-17)
This file consolidates two previously separate skills:
Original Part 1: code_quality_analysis.skill.md (archived at backup/phase2/skills/developer/code_quality_analysis.skill.md.bak_20260117)
Original Part 2: technical_debt_analysis.skill.md (archived at backup/phase2/skills/developer/technical_debt_analysis.skill.md.bak_20260117)

Reason: Both skills use identical analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate, etc.), identical data sources (code repository data, metrics), and produce complementary outputs. Consolidation reduces redundancy while preserving all functionality.

Deprecated stubs have been moved to: backup/phase2/skills/deprecated/
