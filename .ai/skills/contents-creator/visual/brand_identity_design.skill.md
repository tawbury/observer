# Brand Identity Design Skill

<!-- BLOCK:CORE_LOGIC -->
## Core Logic
- Brand identity development & visual system construction with shared framework integration
- Brand values → visual expression system transformation
- Brand consistency, recognition, emotional connection enhancement
- **Integration**: Leverages contents_creation_framework for universal design principles and quality_assurance_framework for brand quality standards
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:INPUT_OUTPUT -->
## Input/Output
### Input
- Brand values & mission & strategic objectives
- Target audience information & market segments
- Competitive brand analysis & positioning
- Visual preference research & brand guidelines

### Output
- Brand identity system with quality validation
- Logo & visual elements with brand consistency
- Brand guidelines with application standards
- Brand application manual with integration reports
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:EXECUTION_LOGIC -->
## Execution Logic

### Framework Integration
```python
def integrate_brand_identity_frameworks():
    """Integrate with _shared frameworks for enhanced brand identity design"""
    
    # 1. Contents Creation Framework Integration
    creation_mode = detect_visual_creation_mode(input_data)
    creation_principles = apply_creation_framework(creation_mode)
    
    # 2. Quality Assurance Framework Integration
    qa_mode = detect_visual_qa_mode(quality_requirements)
    quality_standards = apply_qa_framework(qa_mode)
    
    # 3. Media Integration Framework Integration
    integration_mode = detect_visual_text_integration_mode(input_data)
    integration_strategy = apply_integration_framework(integration_mode)
    
    return {
        'creation_principles': creation_principles,
        'quality_standards': quality_standards,
        'integration_strategy': integration_strategy
    }
```

### Enhanced Brand Identity Pipeline
1. Analyze brand core values & define identity
2. Analyze target audience & competitive environment
3. Integrate shared framework principles for consistency
4. Implement quality assurance standards for brand excellence
5. Apply cross-media integration strategies for brand coherence
6. Generate brand deliverables with quality validation

<!-- BLOCK:TECHNICALREQUIREMENTS -->
## Technical Requirements
- Brand design platforms & visual identity tools (Adobe Creative Suite, Figma)
- Brand management systems & guideline repositories
- Quality assurance platforms & brand testing tools
- Cross-media integration & collaboration platforms
- Asset management systems & version control
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:CONSTRAINTS -->
## Constraints
### Brand Identity Scope
- Brand identity development & visual system construction only
- Brand consistency & recognition enhancement
- Cross-platform brand adaptation & optimization
- Quality assurance integration for brand excellence

### Framework Integration Constraints
- Leverage _shared/contents_creation_framework for universal principles
- Apply _shared/quality_assurance_framework for brand quality standards
- Utilize _shared/media_integration_framework for cross-media consistency
- Maintain brand identity specialization while benefiting from shared frameworks
