# Dev System Architecture Skill

<!-- BLOCK:CORE_LOGIC -->
## Core Logic
- System architecture design and technology stack selection
- Structure design considering scalability/reliability/maintainability
- Microservices/monolithic architecture pattern application
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:INPUT_OUTPUT -->
## Input/Output
### Input
- Business requirements definition
- User scenarios and traffic prediction
- Technical constraints and policies
- Scalability requirements

### Output
