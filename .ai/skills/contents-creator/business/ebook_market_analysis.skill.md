    # 2. Quality Assurance Framework Integration
    qa_mode = detect_business_qa_mode(quality_requirements)
    quality_standards = apply_qa_framework(qa_mode)
    
    # 3. Media Integration Framework Integration
    integration_mode = detect_cross_platform_integration_mode(input_data)
    integration_strategy = apply_integration_framework(integration_mode)
    
    return {
        'strategy_principles': strategy_principles,
        'quality_standards': quality_standards,
        'integration_strategy': integration_strategy
    }
