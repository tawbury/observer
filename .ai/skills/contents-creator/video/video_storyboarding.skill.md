# Video Storyboarding Skill

<!-- BLOCK:CORE_LOGIC -->
## Core Logic
- Video contents planning/visualization through sequential visual expression with shared framework integration
- Narrative flow/scene composition/production requirements overview
- Visual planning, narrative structure visualization, production preparation
- **Integration**: Leverages contents_creation_framework for universal video principles and quality_assurance_framework for storyboard quality standards
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:INPUT_OUTPUT -->
## Input/Output
### Input
- Video concepts & ideas & creative briefs
- Narrative requirements & story structure
- Production constraints & technical specifications
- Target audience information & platform requirements

### Output
- Visual storyboard with quality validation
- Scene composition plan & shot sequencing
- Shot list & timeline with production guidelines
- Production guidelines & resource planning
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:EXECUTION_LOGIC -->
## Execution Logic

### Framework Integration
```python
def integrate_video_storyboarding_frameworks():
    """Integrate with _shared frameworks for enhanced video storyboarding"""
    
    # 1. Contents Creation Framework Integration
    creation_mode = detect_video_creation_mode(input_data)
    creation_principles = apply_creation_framework(creation_mode)
    
    # 2. Quality Assurance Framework Integration
    qa_mode = detect_video_qa_mode(quality_requirements)
    quality_standards = apply_qa_framework(qa_mode)
    
    # 3. Media Integration Framework Integration
    integration_mode = detect_video_business_integration_mode(input_data)
    integration_strategy = apply_integration_framework(integration_mode)
    
    return {
        'creation_principles': creation_principles,
        'quality_standards': quality_standards,
        'integration_strategy': integration_strategy
    }
```

### Enhanced Video Storyboarding Pipeline
1. Analyze video concepts & define narrative structure
2. Plan visual sequences & design scene composition
3. Integrate shared framework principles for consistency
4. Implement quality assurance standards for storyboard excellence
5. Apply cross-media integration strategies for content coherence
6. Generate storyboard deliverables with quality validation

<!-- BLOCK:TECHNICALREQUIREMENTS -->
## Technical Requirements
- Storyboarding tools & visual planning platforms (Storyboard Pro, Frame.io, Miro)
- Video planning software & timeline tools
- Quality assurance platforms & storyboard testing tools
- Cross-media integration & collaboration platforms
- Asset management systems & version control
<!-- END_BLOCK -->

<!-- BLOCK:CONSTRAINTS -->
## Constraints
### Video Storyboarding Scope
- Video storyboarding & visual planning only
- Narrative structure visualization & scene composition
- Cross-platform storyboard adaptation & optimization
- Quality assurance integration for storyboard excellence

### Framework Integration Constraints
- Leverage _shared/contents_creation_framework for universal principles
- Apply _shared/quality_assurance_framework for storyboard quality standards
- Utilize _shared/media_integration_framework for cross-media consistency
- Maintain video storyboarding specialization while benefiting from shared frameworks
